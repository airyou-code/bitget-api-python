# bitget-api-python Library

The `bitget-api-python` library is designed for interacting with the API endpoints of the BitGet exchange. It provides an easy-to-use interface for making authenticated requests to the BitGet trading platform.

## Installation

You can install this library using pip:

```bash
pip install bitget-api-python
```

## Introduction

BitGet is a cryptocurrency exchange platform that offers a wide range of trading features and services. This library allows you to access and utilize the BitGet API to automate trading operations, retrieve market data, and manage your account.

## Authentication

The library provides an authentication class, `BitgetAuth`, that you can use to create an authenticated session with the BitGet API. Here's how to use it:

```python
from bitget_api_python import BitgetAuth

# Replace with your BitGet API credentials
api_key = 'Your API Key'
api_secret = 'Your API Secret'
api_passphrase = 'Your API Passphrase'

# Create an instance of the BitgetAuth class
auth = BitgetAuth(api_key, api_secret, api_passphrase)
```

The `BitgetAuth` class allows you to securely sign requests with your API credentials, ensuring that your account's access to BitGet's resources is authenticated and authorized.

## Making Requests

Once you have an authenticated session with the BitGet API, you can use the `get` and `post` methods to make requests to various API endpoints. Here's how to make a GET request as an example:

```python
# Example GET request to the BitGet API
response = auth.get('/v1/trade/balance')
print(response.json())
```

You can replace `/v1/trade/balance` with the desired endpoint and provide any required parameters or data for your specific API call.
